Image Matching App
Overview

The Image Matching App is a Flutter-based mobile application that allows users to select images from their device camera or gallery, and then compares them to determine if they are the same. The app uses advanced

image processing techniques and provides a simple result in the form of a statement: "Image Matched" if the images are identical or sufficiently similar.

Features:

Image Selection: Users can choose images either by taking a picture using the device camera or selecting an image from the gallery.

Image Matching: The app compares the two images and provides feedback on whether they match.

Instant Feedback: The result is displayed as a simple message: "Image Matched" if the images are identical.

User-Friendly Interface: A clean and simple UI for ease of use.

Tech Stack

Flutter: Used for building the cross-platform mobile app.

Dart: Programming language used for Flutter development.

Image Processing: Basic image comparison algorithms or custom matching logic to evaluate similarity.

How It Works

Select an Image:

The user can take a photo using the device's camera or select one from their photo gallery.

Image Matching:

After selecting two images, the app compares them using an image matching algorithm (e.g., pixel-wise comparison, feature-based matching).

Display Result:

The app displays a statement: "Image Matched" if the two images are considered identical based on the matching algorithm.

Usage

Open the App: Launch the app on your mobile device.

Take or Select Images:

Use the "Camera" option to take a picture.

Use the "Gallery" option to select an image from your deviceâ€™s gallery.
Match Images: Once two images are selected, the app will automatically compare them and display the result.
Result: The app will show "Image Matched" if the images are identical.
